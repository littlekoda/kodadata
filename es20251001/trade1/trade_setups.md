Bias: bullish Action: wait

Setup type: Momentum Exhaustion Fade

HTF: ① 1h trend up ② PDH 6743.5 now acting as support

Signals: ① RSI 85 (extreme) ② Stoch 94 (overbought)

Setup: short @ 6764, stop 6768, T1 6755 (-9 pts, RR≈2.3, 65% hit-rate)
Rationale: Extended above PDH + VWAP σ, momentum stretched, mean-revert pullback likely.
